# SercomSPISlave

## Introduction
This is a Sercom SPI library used for ATSAMD21 boards, such as the Arduino Zero, Arduino MKR ZERO and Adafruit Feather M0. It provides functions to setup SPI Slaves using Sercom0, Sercom1 and Sercom4.

To use it with the Arduino IDE, simply copy the the folder into the Arduino library folder.

Examples are provided to set up a:
- Sercom0 SPI Slave
- Sercom1 SPI Slave
- Sercom4 SPI Slave

### Why would I set up a board as an SPI slave?
Setting up a board as a SPI slave can be used to for instance communicate over SPI between a Raspberry Pi (SPI master) and an ATSAMD21 based board (SPI slave).

## Hardware implementation
The pins used when the board is set up as an SPI Slave using the different Sercom are:
### Sercom0
| SPI pin | description         | ATSAMD21 pin |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| MOSI    | Master Out Slave In | PA08         |
| SCK     | Serial Clock        | PA09         |
| SS      | Slave Select        | PA10         |
| MISO    | Master In Slave Out | PA11         |

### Sercom1
| SPI pin | description         | ATSAMD21 pin |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| MOSI    | Master Out Slave In | PA16         |
| SCK     | Serial Clock        | PA17         |
| SS      | Slave Select        | PA18         |
| MISO    | Master In Slave Out | PA19         |

### Sercom4
| SPI pin | description         | ATSAMD21 pin |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| MOSI    | Master Out Slave In | PA12         |
| SCK     | Serial Clock        | PB09         |
| SS      | Slave Select        | PB10         |
| MISO    | Master In Slave Out | PB11         |

### Example: Adafruit Feather M0
To setup a Sercom4 SPI slave on an Adafruit Feather M0, connect the pins as follows:
| SPI pin | ATSAMD21 pin | Arduino pin | Sercom#/PAD[#] |
|---------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| MOSI    | PA12         | PIN22       | Sercom4/PAD[0] |
| SCK     | PB09         | PIN16       | Sercom4/PAD[1] |
| SS      | PB10         | PIN23       | Sercom4/PAD[2] |
| MISO    | PB11         | PIN24       | Sercom4/PAD[3] |

The pinout of the Adafruit Feather M0 is found [here](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/046/244/original/adafruit_products_Feather_M0_Basic_Proto_v2.2-1.png?1504885373).

Please note that on the Adafruit Feather M0 the pin descriptions on the board do not match how the pins are used when using Sercom4.
